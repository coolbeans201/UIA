# UNIXImageManipulation
Enhanced Image Manipulation Library for UNIX, my Senior Project (CIS 4914) under the direction of Dr. Dave Schmalz. I added the Walsh-Hadamard transform to UIA (UNIX-based Image Analyst), a command-line image manipulation library that is the result of past Senior Projects at the University of Florida. I also provided more documentation and enhanced existing functionality.
